Project Overview

This project aims to predict house rental prices in Hyderabad using various machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes information on various features that can influence rental prices, such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and other amenities. The primary goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the rent based on these features.

The dataset used in this project consists of several features that influence house rent prices in Hyderabad:

Location: The area or neighborhood of the house.
Size: The size of the house in square feet.
Bedrooms: The number of bedrooms in the house.
Furnishing Status: Whether the house is furnished, semi-furnished, or unfurnished.
Age of Property: The age of the property in years.

Usage
Preprocess the data: Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and normalize numerical features.

Train the model: Use various machine learning algorithms to train the model on the dataset.

Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics.

Make predictions: Use the trained model to predict house rent prices based on new data.
